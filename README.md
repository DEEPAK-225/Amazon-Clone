# Amazon Clone
This repository contains a simple clone of the user interface (UI) of the popular e-commerce platform Amazon, built using only HTML and CSS. The project aims to replicate the basic layout and visual design of the Amazon website, including the header, navigation menu, product listings, and footer. By creating this clone, I aim to practice my front-end development skills and gain experience and visually appealing web interfaces using HTML and CSS. Please note that this clone does not include any functional or interactive features such as user authentication, product browsing, or checkout process. It is purely a static representation of the Amazon website's UI.
